# DOOR LOCK SYSTEM


## Introduction
One of the features that most new entries into the Indian vehicle industry have is locking. New cars are typically equipped with a power-operated locking mechanism that is linked to the vehicle's alarm system. Each automobile key includes a unique code that synchronises with the vehicle's alarm system. The engine immobiliser is turned off after the automobile is locked using the key. The system will be implemented back up only when the same code is received from the car key.

The locking system in a vehicle must grant access only to authorised persons. It is the means via which the vehicle doors and boot lid are locked and unlocked and the engine is started.The locking system is operated with a key or remote control. Keyless systems are increasingly being used to start engines. In a keyless system, a transmitter – which usually also houses the controller for the central locking – is inserted into a reader in the vehicle and the engine is then started by pressing a button. A more recent development has seen the use of systems that work without any contact at all.

### WHERE :
The central locking system may not be a standard feature in your car, but it might be offered as an optional one. One can easily fit this system in their cars from workshops and they aren’t expensive or difficult to install.

### WHEN :
Until the 1960s, some ford cars still had different keys for the doors and the ignition. A combined key for all purposes, the precursor of today’s locking systems, gained popularity as the decade wore on. There are several types of central locking systems available today. It is possible to use a remote from a distance and operate the locks of the car. Some of the remotes can also set off the alarm of the vehicle.


### How:-
To secure the automobile from the inside, the driver simply locks one of the front doors with the key, and all of the doors automatically lock. By manually locking or unlocking the driver's side door lock or pushing the lock and unlock buttons on the key fob or dashboard, the driver can lock or unlock all doors.
