**What:** A power side-view mirror (power side mirror, power wing mirror, or simply power mirror) is a side-view mirror equipped with electrical means for vertical and horizontal adjustment from the inside of the automobile.

**Where:** It allows you to connect and mirror your phone to PC via USB or WiFi, and you can remotely control Android from PC or Mac using your mouse and keyboard.

**Why:** A side-view mirror (or side mirror), also known as a wing mirror, is a mirror placed on the exterior of motor vehicles for the purposes of helping the driver see areas behind and to the sides of the vehicle, outside the driver's peripheral vision (in the "blind spot").

**When:** Power windows were first introduced by Ford Motors in 1941. The first cars to get the power windows were the Lincoln Custom and the Packard Custom Super 180.

**How:**Each rear view mirror has two DC motors. ... Electricity then flows through the switch to the DC motor and the mirror head moves in the intended direction. If you press the same switch to the opposite direction, you are reversing the electricity to the mirror motor and the mirror moves in the opposite direction
